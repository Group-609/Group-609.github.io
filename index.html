        <p>Darkness has surrounded your colorful town. The corruption started spreading and spawning evil colorless creatures.
        Some call them "ink monsters". They destroy everything that's still vivid and lively in this town. The fountains, filled
        with magical water of life, are getting destroyed. Luckily, you and your friend manage to fill your tanks
        with the yet uncorrupted water. This is the only way to restore color. Save the town from ink monsters and cleanse the fountains water!</p>
        
        <p><i>Remember: you wield a powerful weapon that is filled with magical water. This will not only damage the ink monsters,
        but it will also help your teammate recover.</i></p>
